<h2>ingredients</h2>
<p>BOBA PEARLS <br>

    ⅓ cup water(75 g), plus more as needed<br>
    ¼ cup dark muscovado sugar(55 g), or brown sugar<br>
    ¾ cup tapioca flour(65 g), plus more for dusting<br>
    BROWN SUGAR SYRUP<br>
    
    1 cup dark muscovado sugar(220 g), or brown sugar<br>
    1 cup water(240 mL)<br>
    BLACK TEA<br>
    
    2 cups water(480 mL)<br>
    6 black tea bags<br>
    MILK MIXTURE<br>
    
    3 tablespoons half & half<br>
    3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk<br>
    ASSEMBLY<br>
    
    3 cups ice(450 g), divided<br>
    SPECIAL EQUIPMENT<br>
    
    wide-opening straw</p>
    <h3>method</h3>
    <p>
   - Make the boba pearls: Add the water and muscovado sugar to a medium pan<br>
    over medium-high heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes<br>
     to a boil, 3–4 minutes. Add a bit of the tapioca flour and cook, stirring <br>
     constantly, until smooth. Add half of the remaining tapioca flour and stir<br>
      vigorously until a sticky dough forms. Turn off the heat and add the remaining tapioca<br>
       flour. Stir until the dough comes together in a ball (not all of the flour will be incorporated<br> 
       at this stage). Let cool slightly.<br>
    -Turn the dough out onto a clean surface. Knead until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough<br>
     is smooth, adding more flour or water as needed if the dough is too sticky or too dry.<br>
    -Divide the dough into 2 portions. Roll the dough into long, thin ropes about ¼-inch (6.35 mm) thick,<br>
     cutting in half crosswise if they get too long. Cut the ropes into ¼-inch (6.35 mm) pieces. Roll <br>
     each piece into a ball and place in a bowl with a bit of tapioca flour. Dust the balls with the flour<br>
      to prevent them from sticking to each other.
   - Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Shake off any excess flour from the tapioca pearls, then add <br>
    to the boiling water. Stir to separate the pearls, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently,<br>
     stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until cooked through.<br>
   - Meanwhile, make the brown sugar syrup: Add the muscovado sugar and water to a small saucepan over<br>
     medium heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the syrup reduces slightly, 5–7 minutes. Pour the<br>
      syrup into a large heatproof bowl.<br>
    Once the pearls have cooked through, drain and rinse with cold water. Add the pearls to the bowl with<br>
     the brown sugar syrup and let sit for 30–60 minutes.<br>
   - Make the black tea: In a medium pot over high heat, combine the water and tea bags. Bring to a boil,<br>
     then remove the pan from the heat and let the tea cool to room temperature.<br>
   - Make the milk mixture: In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the half-and-half and<br>
     sweetened condensed milk until combined.<br>
   - Assemble the boba milk tea: Add about ⅓ cup (80 ml) boba pearls and brown sugar syrup to the bottom <br>
    of each glass. Top with 1½ cups (225 grams) ice, then add ½ cup (240 ml) black tea and 3 tablespoons<br>
     of the milk mixture. Stir with a wide-opening straw, then serve.<br>
