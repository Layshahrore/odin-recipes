<h2>ingredients</h2>
<p>
    Butter — buy unsalted butter to control the amount of salt added to the cake and frosting.<br>
    Make sure the butter is at room temperature so it’ll be easier to cream.<br>
   
   Lemon — fresh lemon juice is key to a delicious cake. Fresh lemon juice has a <br>
   brighter flavor than bottled lemon juice. As the recipe calls for lemon zest, <br>
   you’ll need fresh lemons anyways! <br>
   
   Buttermilk — don’t skip adding buttermilk to your cake batter, as it gives the<br> 
   cake a tangy flavor and adds fluffiness and moisture to the crumb. If you do not<br>
    have any, see my post on how to make buttermilk with only two ingredients.<br>

    Cream cheese — for the lemon cream cheese frosting, I recommend using full-fat cream<br>
     cheese as it will give the frosting a creamy consistency that’s also slightly tangy.<br>
      Get the blocks of cream cheese, not the spreadable cream cheese tubs.<br>
      

      Powdered sugar — you must use powdered sugar as it’ll quickly dissolve into the frosting,<br>
       making it creamy and sweet.<br>
    </p>

<h3>method</h3>
<p>
    1. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>

    2. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. <br>
    Beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar and lemon zest and beat until<br>
     light and fluffy.<br>
     3. Add the vanilla then eggs one at a time, scrape down the bowl between additions, and beat<br>
      until well combined and fluffy.<br>

     4. Stir the buttermilk and lemon juice together. With the mixer on low speed, add a third of the<br>
    flour mixture, followed by half of the milk mixture. Continue, alternating between the flour and<br>
    milk, mixing just until combined. Divide the batter among two greased 8-inch cake pans. Bake for<br>
     35 to 40 minutes, then let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to <br>
    cool completely.<br>
    5. To make the frosting, beat the butter and cream cheese together until creamy. Add the lemon zest<br>
     and beat until light and fluffy before adding the powdered sugar alternating with a little bit of <br>
     the lemon juice. Beat in the vanilla and continue to beat until smooth and fluffy. Place one layer<br> 
     on a cake stand or serving plate. Top with 1 cup of frosting, spreading smoothly out to the edges.<br>

     6. Top with the second cake layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the outside of the cake.<br>
      Decorate the lemon cake with thin lemon slices or edible flowers, if desired<br>
